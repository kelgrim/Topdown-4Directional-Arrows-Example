# Example of 4 directional movement with arrows. 

Arrows explode similarly to the original Zelda game.
If you hold down fire for a second, it will shoot a power shot. 

Controles:
WASD for movement. 
Space for shooting

I created this very quickly, so don't expect the controls to feel good, it's just a quick example.
